## ...this site

This is my personal site where I keep all kinds of stuff related to IT, photography and any other thoughts.

This site has been created with [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) - a static website engine - and [atom](https://atom.io/) - a highly customisable editor. The look & feel is based on the [hugo-uno](https://github.com/SenjinDarashiva/hugo-uno) theme.

## ...me

I'm an software architect / engineer based out of Stuttgart, Germany. I focus mainly on everything java and enterprise.

Besides my usual interest in design and performance, currently I'm deeply interested in anything related to improving the overall development performance - especially in larger teams. This spans from the usual suspects like continuous integration and delivery to thigs like container virtualization and model driven software development.

Currently I'm employed by [W&W Informatik GmbH](http://www.ww-informatik.de/), the only IT supplier for the [W&W AG](http://www.ww-ag.de). The thoughts and opinions expressed on this site are solely my own and have no relationship to my employer.
