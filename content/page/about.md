## ...this site

This is my personal site where I keep all kinds of stuff related to IT, photography and any other thoughts.

This blog has been created with [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), a static website engine. The theme is based on the [hugo-uno](https://github.com/SenjinDarashiva/hugo-uno) theme.

## ...me

I'm an software architect / engineer based out of Stuttgart, Germany. I focus mainly on everything java and enterprise.

Besides my usual interest in design and performance, currently I'm deeply interested in anything related to improving the overall development performance - especially in larger teams. This spans from the usual suspects like continuous integration and delivery to thigs like container virtualization and model driven software development.

Currently I'm employed by [CGI](http://www.cgi.com/), a global IT consulting company. The thoughts and opinions expressed on this site are solely my own and have no relationship to my employer.
