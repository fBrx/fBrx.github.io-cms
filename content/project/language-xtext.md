## Overview

This repository contains a package which adds syntax highlighting for  [Xtext](http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/) to your favorite editor (which is [atom](https://atom.io/ ) btw).

From the Xtext homepage:

> Xtext is a framework for development of programming languages and domain specific languages.

>It covers all aspects of a complete language infrastructure, from parsers, over linker, compiler or interpreter to fully-blown top-notch Eclipse IDE integration. It comes with great defaults for all these aspects which at the same time can be easily tailored to your individual needs.

## Current State

The current state of the project is pretty much wip - with the only problem beeing, that I don't have much time to put any more effort into this.

So if there are any contributions I would be happy to include them.

## Installation

Since this package has not yet been published to atom.io you have to install it manually. For this you can just clone the repository into your ```~/.atom/packages``` directory.

```
cd ~/.atom/packages
git clone https://github.com/fBrx/language-xtext.git
```

Restart atom and enjoy the magic.
